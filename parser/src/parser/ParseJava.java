/**
 * Indent four spaces within nested control structures such as loops and if-then statements.
 * The interior of curly brackets {}, for example, would be indented four spaces.
 * The left curly bracket { should be on a line by itself and aligned with the previous lineâ€™s
 * indention.
 * The right curly bracket } should be on a line by itself and aligned with its matching curly
 * bracket {.
 * Binary operators, e.g., a * b, should have a blank on either side of the operator.
 * Unary operators, e.g., i++, should be adjacent to their operand.
